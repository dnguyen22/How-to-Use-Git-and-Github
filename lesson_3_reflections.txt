Starting lesson 3:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You may want to use a remote repository if you are working from a different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps you have local changes you don't want overridden by an automatic update from Git.
