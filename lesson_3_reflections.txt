Starting lesson 3:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You may want to use a remote repository if you are working from a different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps you have local changes you don't want overridden by an automatic update from Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks occur on GitHub when you want to make a copy of a repository, while giving credit to the original without actually making edits to the original.

clones are to make a copy of a repository from GitHub to local or from local to local. 

branches are used to create another path on the project. This is typically done for smaller changes like different versions of the software, new features, a testing version, or to create a production version.
